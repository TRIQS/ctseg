This is a script for the periodic anderson model, written for the segment solver (with offdiagonal hybridization) and for the matrix solver (one has to use the 1.0 version of TRIQS for the matrix version). Both give similar results at high temperature, but produce an unwanted symmetry breaking between the orbitals at low temperature. This can be avoided by using the supplementary moves "move_move" and "move_swap_empty_lines" in the segment solver.
