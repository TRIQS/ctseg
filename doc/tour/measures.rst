Measurements
===============

The solver provides provides measurements for various observables, which in turn can be measured in different bases. We list them here alongside with their definitions.

All measurements can be turned on or off through the expert interface.

One-variable correlation functions
------------------------------------------------

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

Multivariable correlation functions
------------------------------------------------

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1
