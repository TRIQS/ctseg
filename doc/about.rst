The continuous-time hybridization-expansion segment solver has been written by
T. Ayral, H. Hafermann, P.Delange, M. Ferrero and O. Parcollet.


Useful references
==================

This implementation is based on
a hybridization expansion of the partition function as described in reference
[#werner06]_, with dynamical interactions in the charge and longitudinal spin channel (as described in [#werner07]_) as well as transverse spin channel (as described in [#otsuki13]_).
The computation of the one-particle Greenâ€™s
function has been improved with the use of Legendre polynomials following
reference [#boehnke]_. The various improved estimators implemented in the code follow [#hafermann12]_ and [#hafermann14]_.
The code is based on the TRIQS toolbox [#parcollet15]_.
