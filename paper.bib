	abstract = {Quantum impurity models describe an atom or molecule embedded in a host material with which it can exchange electrons. They are basic to nanoscience as representations of quantum dots and molecular conductors and play an increasingly important role in the theory of "correlated electron" materials as auxiliary problems whose solution gives the "dynamical mean-field" approximation to the self-energy and local correlation functions. These applications require a method of solution which provides access to both high and low energy scales and is effective for wide classes of physically realistic models. The continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms reviewed in this article meet this challenge. Derivations and descriptions of the algorithms are presented in enough detail to allow other workers to write their own implementations, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the methods, summarize the problems to which the new methods have been successfully applied, and outline prospects for future applications. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {A vector bosonic field coupled to the electronic spin is treated by means of the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method. In the Bose-Kondo model with a sub-Ohmic density of states ρB(ω)ωs with s=0.2, two contributions to the spin susceptibility, the Curie term T-1 and the term T-s due to bosonic fluctuations, are observed separately. This result indicates the existence of a residual moment and a hidden critical behavior. By including hybridization with itinerant electrons, a quantum critical point is identified between this local-moment state and the Kondo singlet state. It is demonstrated that the energy scale of the bosonic fluctuations is not affected by the quantum phase transition. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

@article{TRIQS2015,
abstract = {We present the TRIQS library, a Toolbox for Research on Interacting Quantum Systems. It is an open-source, computational physics library providing a framework for the quick development of applications in the field of many-body quantum physics, and in particular, strongly-correlated electronic systems. It supplies components to develop codes in a modern, concise and efficient way: e.g. Green's function containers, a generic Monte Carlo class, and simple interfaces to HDF5. TRIQS is a C++/Python library that can be used from either language. It is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPLv3). State-of-the-art applications based on the library, such as modern quantum many-body solvers and interfaces between density-functional-theory codes and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) codes are distributed along with it.

Solution method: We present a C++/Python open-source computational library that provides high-level abstractions for common objects and various tools in the field of quantum many-body physics, thus forming a framework for developing applications.
