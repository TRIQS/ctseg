	abstract = {Quantum impurity models describe an atom or molecule embedded in a host material with which it can exchange electrons. They are basic to nanoscience as representations of quantum dots and molecular conductors and play an increasingly important role in the theory of "correlated electron" materials as auxiliary problems whose solution gives the "dynamical mean-field" approximation to the self-energy and local correlation functions. These applications require a method of solution which provides access to both high and low energy scales and is effective for wide classes of physically realistic models. The continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms reviewed in this article meet this challenge. Derivations and descriptions of the algorithms are presented in enough detail to allow other workers to write their own implementations, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the methods, summarize the problems to which the new methods have been successfully applied, and outline prospects for future applications. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {A vector bosonic field coupled to the electronic spin is treated by means of the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method. In the Bose-Kondo model with a sub-Ohmic density of states ρB(ω)ωs with s=0.2, two contributions to the spin susceptibility, the Curie term T-1 and the term T-s due to bosonic fluctuations, are observed separately. This result indicates the existence of a residual moment and a hidden critical behavior. By including hybridization with itinerant electrons, a quantum critical point is identified between this local-moment state and the Kondo singlet state. It is demonstrated that the energy scale of the bosonic fluctuations is not affected by the quantum phase transition. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Strongly correlated quantum impurity problems appear in a wide variety of contexts ranging from nanoscience and surface physics to material science and the theory of strongly correlated lattice models, where they appear as auxiliary systems within dynamical mean-field theory. Accurate and unbiased solutions must usually be obtained numerically, and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, a family of algorithms based on the stochastic sampling of partition function expansions, perform well for such systems. With the present paper we provide an efficient and generic implementation of the hybridization expansion quantum impurity solver, based on the segment representation. We provide a complete implementation featuring most of the recently developed extensions and optimizations. Our implementation allows one to treat retarded interactions and provides generalized measurement routines based on improved estimators for the self-energy and for vertex functions. The solver is embedded in the ALPS-DMFT application package.

Computer: Desktop PC, high-performance computers. Operating system: Unix, Linux, OSX, Windows. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes, MPI parallelized. RAM: 1 GB Classification: 7.3. External routines: ALPS [1, 2, 3], BLAS [4, 5], LAPACK [6], HDF5 [7] Nature of problem: Quantum impurity models were originally introduced to describe a magnetic transition metal ion in a non-magnetic host metal. They are widely used today. In nanoscience they serve as representations of quantum dots and molecular conductors. In condensed matter physics, they are playing an increasingly important role in the description of strongly correlated electron materials, where the complicated many-body problem is mapped onto an auxiliary quantum impurity model in the context of dynamical mean-field theory, and its cluster and diagrammatic extensions. They still constitutes a non-trivial many-body problem, which takes into account the (possibly retarded) interaction between electrons occupying the impurity site. Electrons are allowed to dynamically hop on and off the impurity site, which is described by a time-dependent hybridization function. Solution method: The quantum impurity model is solved using a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm which is based on a perturbation expansion of the partition function in the impurity–bath hybridization. Monte Carlo configurations are represented as segments on the imaginary time interval and individual terms correspond to Feynman diagrams which are stochastically sampled to all orders using a Metropolis algorithm.
